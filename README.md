## About:
The Stories Made Simple web application provides a place for writers to easily plot out their stories using a selection of plotting methods. This application is educational as well as functional. The user is able to select how many books the plot covers, what genre, the desired word count per book as well as the desired word count average per chapter, and then have all their books laid out by big picture all the way down to per chapter. Once the plot framework is laid out, the user may enter plot information into each spot and consolidate this information to be printed out.

## Future Goals:
  - [ ] Making user profiles where each writer can display their Author Biography and published works.
  - [ ] The ability to "friend" other users.
  - [ ] Plot Building Collaberation between users.
  - [ ] Plot review and commentary by selected users only.
